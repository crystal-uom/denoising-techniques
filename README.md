# denoising-techniques
A collection of denoising technique experimenting to denoise OCT B-Scans. Includes conventional and modern methods.

## Conventional Methods

### Wavelet Transform & Wavelet thresholding
[Devnith] Currently working on wavelet transform based denoising methods using MATLAB and Python.

### BM3D
[Nadun & Ravindu] Planning to estimate the noise for improve the results.

- Code Inspiration : https://github.com/ChihaoZhang/BM3D

### Gaussian Filters
[Nadun] Applied simple gaussian filters for different gaussian noise sigma values.
