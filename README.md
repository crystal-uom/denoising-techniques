# denoising-techniques
A collection of denoising technique experimenting to denoise OCT B-Scans. Includes conventional and modern methods.

## Conventional Methods

### 1. Wavelet Transform & Wavelet thresholding
[Devnith] Currently working on wavelet transform based denoising methods using MATLAB and Python.

### 2. BM3D
Old approach: [Nadun & Ravindu] Used the implementation by Chihao Zhang at "https://github.com/ChihaoZhang/BM3D".
Latest approach: [Nadun] Used the bm3d python library based on original bm3d paper.

#### BM3D Comparison
