# denoising-techniques
A collection of denoising technique experimenting to denoise OCT B-Scans. Includes conventional and modern methods.

## Conventional Methods

### 1. Wavelet Transform & Wavelet thresholding
[Devnith] Currently working on wavelet transform based denoising methods using MATLAB and Python.

### 2. BM3D
[Nadun & Ravindu] Planning to estimate the noise for improve the results.
